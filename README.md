# Voxel Engine
This is a voxel engine that has been written on C++ and significantly modified compared with a Python version. I added a terrain and water generation, structures and caves system. I've came across some major bugs and don't have time to fix them. Also, I tried to implement an on-the-go terrain editor, using Imgui.
